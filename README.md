 ## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Devin McDonald!

Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at NYU, graduating in December 2024, with a strong foundation in AI, ML, data science, and full-stack software engineering. With 7 years of experience as a Chemical Engineer, I bring a methodical, scientific approach to problem-solving, and Iâ€™m passionate about applying these skills to tackle complex challenges in the tech world!

Take a look at my Tech stack in my Toolbox below!
